###Wordpress Theme

Create simple theme of only one page, which lists active posts (with navigation).
Item must contain post title and thumbnail.
Sorting will be done by "rating" of the post in DESC order.
Wordpress does not provide rating property by default, therefore it is needed
to add a custom field parameter so every post has an input text field in admin edit
area, where he will input a value between 0 and 5.
